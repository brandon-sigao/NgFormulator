// CURRENT
 -form group (new styling based on what Candace showed me)

// TODO (short term)
-make date/time control 
-add about a billion more tests
-create UI component for:
    -radio field
    -multi-select field
    -date/time field
   
    -date/time
- subdivide columns (make it so you can stack two 3s horizontally under a 6 in a multi-line row)
- custom validation messages
- margin to top/bottom of inputs
- try and get it as mobile compliant as we can

// TODO (medium term)
-Increase customizations on components
    -Possibly allow custom classes? configuration object?
    -definitely want to keep the concept of focused/unfocused and let the user apply things in either case

// TODO (Long term)
-Add show/hide logic
    -make sure validations don't fail when hidden
    -allow show/hide on a group level
    -figure out if controls should collapse on disappear or keep their sizing?
